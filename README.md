# Awesome Hyperledger Indy [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of resources for creating applications with Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger, purpose-built for decentralized identity. It provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for creating and using independent digital
identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers.

## Distributed Ledger
- [indy-node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node) - Embodies all the functionality to run nodes (validators and/or observers) that provide a self-sovereign identity ecosystem on top of a distributed ledger.
- [indy-plenum](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum) - Plenum Byzantine Fault Tolerant Protocol.


## Client tools
- [indy-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk) -  Official SDK, which provides a distributed-ledger-based foundation for self-sovereign identity. 
- [indy-agent](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent) - Messaging web applications.


## Shared Components
- [indy-hipe](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe) - Project enhancements, pronounced like "hype" for short, for chunks of technology or process that are important to standardize across the Indy ecosystem.
- [indy-crypto](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto) - Shared crypto library for the components.
